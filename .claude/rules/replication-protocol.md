# Replication-First Protocol

**Core principle:** Replicate original results to the dot BEFORE extending.

---

## Phase 1: Inventory & Baseline

Before writing any replication code (R or Stata):

- [ ] Read the paper's replication README
- [ ] Inventory replication package: language, data files, scripts, outputs
- [ ] Record gold standard numbers from the paper:

```markdown
## Replication Targets: [Paper Author (Year)]

| Target | Table/Figure | Value | SE/CI | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Main ATT | Table 2, Col 3 | -1.632 | (0.584) | Primary specification |
```

- [ ] Store targets in `quality_reports/LectureNN_replication_targets.md` (or as RDS/.dta)

---

## Phase 2: Translate & Execute

- [ ] Follow `r-code-conventions.md` (R) or `stata-code-conventions.md` (Stata) for coding standards
- [ ] Translate line-by-line initially -- don't "improve" during replication
- [ ] Match original specification exactly (covariates, sample, clustering, SE computation)
- [ ] Save all intermediate results as RDS (R) or .dta (Stata)

### Stata to R Translation Pitfalls

<!-- Customize: Add pitfalls specific to your field -->

| Stata | R | Trap |
|-------|---|------|
| `reg y x, cluster(id)` | `feols(y ~ x, cluster = ~id)` | Stata clusters df-adjust differently from some R packages |
| `areg y x, absorb(id)` | `feols(y ~ x \| id)` | Check demeaning method matches |
| `probit` for PS | `glm(family=binomial(link="probit"))` | R default logit != Stata default in some commands |
| `bootstrap, reps(999)` | Depends on method | Match seed, reps, and bootstrap type exactly |

### R to Stata Translation Pitfalls

| R | Stata | Trap |
|---|-------|------|
| `feols(y ~ x \| id)` | `reghdfe y x, absorb(id)` | `reghdfe` requires `ssc install`; built-in `areg` handles only one FE |
| `set.seed(42)` | `set seed 42` + `set sortseed 42` | Stata also needs `set sortseed` for deterministic sort order |
| `NA` handling (automatic) | `.` missing values | Stata silently treats `.` as +infinity in comparisons — use `if !mi(var)` |
| `factor(var)` in formula | `i.var` prefix | Stata requires explicit factor notation |
| `robust` SEs via `vcov` | `, robust` or `, vce(robust)` | Default SE methods differ — always specify explicitly in both |

---

## Phase 3: Verify Match

### Tolerance Thresholds

| Type | Tolerance | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Integers (N, counts) | Exact match | No reason for any difference |
| Point estimates | < 0.01 | Rounding in paper display |
| Standard errors | < 0.05 | Bootstrap/clustering variation |
| P-values | Same significance level | Exact p may differ slightly |
| Percentages | < 0.1pp | Display rounding |

### If Mismatch

**Do NOT proceed to extensions.** Isolate which step introduces the difference, check common causes (sample size, SE computation, default options, variable definitions), and document the investigation even if unresolved.

### Replication Report

Save to `quality_reports/LectureNN_replication_report.md`:

```markdown
# Replication Report: [Paper Author (Year)]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Original language:** [Stata/R/etc.]
**Replication script:** [script path]

## Summary
- **Targets checked / Passed / Failed:** N / M / K
- **Overall:** [REPLICATED / PARTIAL / FAILED]

## Results Comparison

| Target | Paper | Ours | Diff | Status |
|--------|-------|------|------|--------|

## Discrepancies (if any)
- **Target:** X | **Investigation:** ... | **Resolution:** ...

## Environment
- Language version (R version / Stata version), key packages (with versions), data source
```

---

## Phase 4: Only Then Extend

After replication is verified (all targets PASS):

- [ ] Commit replication script: "Replicate [Paper] Table X -- all targets match"
- [ ] Now extend with course-specific modifications (different estimators, new figures, etc.)
- [ ] Each extension builds on the verified baseline
